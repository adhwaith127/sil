im trying to implement a canteen token based food management system
to get the idea whatever doubt u may have u can ask to get the full picture of the project
currently an employee scans his face
it checks it with db inside and if its present send that data to server to check if its a created user
if created user, then display success message
on successful authentication, goto an option selection like meal type selection breakfast or lunch or evening snacks
this is a multilayered setup
super admin(probably us)
admin(different companies)-they create and add branches
branch(of diff companies)-inside are the employees
each device unique to branch
each branch might have multiple facial scanners and printers
printers meaning token dispensers
different models are required
for company
branch 
users(user details, facial scanner id, allocated printer or id ; not quite sure about teh constraints)
these are the basic details off the top of my head
in case of doubts ask away
